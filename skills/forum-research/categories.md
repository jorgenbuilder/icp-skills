## Best Practices for Agents

1. **Start broad, narrow down:** Begin with main categories, then filter by subcategories or tags
2. **Use JSON endpoints:** Prefer `.json` URLs for structured data
3. **Check activity levels:** Higher activity categories (Developers, Governance) have more current information
4. **Cross-reference:** Some topics span categories (e.g., SNS appears in Developers and Community)
5. **Read pinned topics:** Category "About" topics provide context
6. **Respect read-only:** Never attempt to post, reply, or modify content

## Activity Patterns

**Most Active:** Developers (19/week) - Best for current technical discussions
**Active:** Governance (7/week) - Active proposals and debates
**Moderate:** General (4/week), Watercooler (2/week) - Community engagement
**Low:** Community (1/week), Roadmap (1/week) - Infrequent but high-value content
